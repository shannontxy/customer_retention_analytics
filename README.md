# customer_retention_analytics

Customer retention analytics has been providing crucial information to businesses. Companies that leverage on these customer data might be able to see profits improve up to as high as 126% (McKinsey, 2014). These data analytics are beneficial to businesses as they are able to generate predictive metrics of their customersâ€™ churn, allowing them to foresee which group of customers are more likely to stop supporting their products, thereby coming up with measures beforehand to appeal to these groups of customers.

The focus of our analysis would be to predict the success of customer retention efforts among existing customers and devising a personalised strategy for these customers for improved retention. Through this, we hope to retain customers by converting customers with the greatest potential of leaving to customers who would potentially stay on with the help of marketing efforts.
